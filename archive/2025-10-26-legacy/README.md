# 2025-10-26 Legacy Snapshot

This directory stores the pre-React exploratory assets that are not needed for the running Flask app but remain useful as references.

## Contents
- `docs/`, `scripts/`, `__marimo__/`: documentation, automation spikes, and marimo notebooks that informed earlier workflows.
- Notebooks: `nemlig.ipynb`, `openai-assistants.ipynb`, `roulette.ipynb`, `stats.ipynb`, `testing.ipynb` for historical analysis and experiments.
- Legacy scripts: `editor.py`, `nemlig_testing.py`, `udisc-testing.py`, `recipes_site.py`, `reflex_app.py`, `yaml_to_peewee.py`.
- Reports & misc artifacts: `chapter_break.tex`, `color-text-span.lua`, `config.yml`, `example.md`, `recipe-list.txt`, `recipes.json`.
- Menu/YAML exports now live under `menu_exports/` (all `uge_*` and `week-{today.week}-{today.year}.yaml`).

Everything here was copied directly from the repository root on 2025-10-26. Move any additional legacy material into a dated folder under `archive/` to keep the root clean going forward.
